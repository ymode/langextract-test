This four-channel software-\nprogrammable radio delivers advanced Link 16 capabilities and TACAN \nfunctionality, as well as three channels for growth.\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nThe terminal\u2019s dedicated Link 16 channel ensures full interoperability with MIDS-LVT and \nSmall Form Factor (SFF) Link 16 terminals to exchange tactical information in real-time.\nBy retaining the existing MIDS-LVT form factor and interfaces, the MIDS JTRS terminal \nfacilitates integration into platforms that already host MIDS-LVT. This approach enables \nexisting LVT users to take advantage of the benefits of upgrading to MIDS JTRS, which \nincludes TACAN and enhanced Link 16 capabilities\u2014Concurrent Multi-Netting (CMN), \nConcurrent Contention Receive (CCR), Enhanced Throughput (ET), Frequency Remapping \n(FR), and Cryptographic Modernization\u2014while minimizing platform integration costs. \nMIDS JTRS provides today\u2019s warfighters with a common tactical picture via Link 16,  \nand three software-defined channels for future growth.KEY FEATURES\n >CMN/CCR enables 4x receive \ncapacity while maintaining \ninteroperability\n >Enhanced throughput boosts  \nLink 16 data rate\n >Full Frequency Remapping \npermits banded operation\n >Crypto modernized with \nreprogrammable security\n >Simultaneous cryptographically-\nisolated 4-channel operation\n >Software programmable\n >Same form factor as MIDS-LVT for \nreduced integration costs\n >Fully interoperable with MIDS-LVT \nand SFF Link 16 terminals\n >Full access to Link 16 real-time \nsituational awareness and \nCommand & Control (C2)Plug-and-Play Installation \nand Interoperability\nUse of U.S. DoD visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.\u00a0THIS INFORMATION IS APPROVED FOR RELEASE WITHOUT EXPORT RESTRICTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH A \nREVIEW OF THE  INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN ARMS REGULATIONS (ITAR), 22CFR 120-130, AND THE EXPORT \nADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (EAR) 15 CFR 730-774. \nL3Harris Technologies is the Trusted Disruptor for the global aerospace and defense industry.

The \nterminal can receive multiple messages in the same time slot, \nincreasing the receive capacity by four times that of a legacy \nLink 16 terminal. Concurrent Multi-Net (CMN-4) enables multiple \nmessages to be received within a time slot using four different net \nnumbers. For example, warfighters will be able to monitor four \nzones of surveillance. The operator also gets much faster updates \nwhen multiple messages with the same net number are received \nwithin a time slot from users at different ranges (e.g. fighter-to-\nfighter) using Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR).\nThe system\u2019s Enhanced Throughput mode boosts Link 16\u2019s \nprotected data rate of 115 Kbps to over 1 Mbps. Frequency \nRemapping is also supported, enabling the warfighter to use \nbanded Link 16 to avoid interference with other systems. With \nCrypto Modernization, MIDS JTRS implements new encryption \nalgorithms to ensure secure coalition communications across  \nthe network.\nGROWTH TO SUPPORT THE WARFIGHTER TOMORROW\nWith three universal channels available, L3Harris\u2019 MIDS JTRS \nterminal is ready for legacy as well as the next generation \nof IP-based tactical networking. The terminal architecture \naccommodates modern transceivers to support advanced \nnetworking waveforms to deliver greater network capacity and \nmuch lower latency for sensor and processing sharing.SPECIFICATIONS\nPERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\n >Link 16 messaging:  TADIL J per MIL -STD-6016\n >Transmit spectral performance :  Greater than -60 dBc in \n1030/1090 MHz bands\n >Output transmit power:  1, 25 or 200 Watts + HPA \ninterface\n >Host interfaces:   MIL -STD-1553,  \nethernet, and voice\n >L -16 data throughput:  26.8 through 1102 kbps TADIL \nJ coded, free text variable \nformat or enhanced throughput\n >Keyfill:  DS-101\n >Voice capability:  L -16: 2.4 kbps LPC-10  \nand 16 kbps CVSD \n >TACAN capability:  Air-to-ground, air-to-air\n >Programmable channel:  3 Channels\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n >Main terminal and RFA:  7.62\" (w) x 7.5\" (h) x 13.5\" (d)  \n(19.35 cm x 19.05 cm x 34.29 cm)\n >Power Supply (PS):  7.62\" (w) x 2.252\" (h) x 13.46\" (d)  \n(19.35 x 5.72 x 34.19 cm)\n >Volume: 1002.5 in3 (16,428.03 cc)\n >Weight:\n -MIDS JTRS RT LRU 50.6 lb (22.95 Kg)\n -MIDS JTRS PS LRU 14 lb (6.49 Kg)\nPOWER AND COOLING\n >Power source alternatives:  115 VAC (400 Hz) 3 Phase  \nor \u00b1 140 VDC\n >Power consumption:  0% TSDF 150 Watts,  \n70% TSDF 350 Watts\n >Cooling: External Forced Air\n1025 W.

This terminal \nis packaged in an affordable, industry-standard compact form factor \nand is ruggedized to meet demanding environmental requirements.\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\nThe STT brings real-time situational awareness, location data and command and control \n(C2) to tactical gateways and edge warfighters. With this terminal, edge users have access \nto both air and ground (friendly and enemy) situation data and can provide secure and \nreliable target data to the network. With the UHF channel configured for S-TADIL J or JRE, \nusers have a single terminal that provides both LOS and BLOS TADIL J connectivity. \nThe STT can be used to bridge the gap in user\u2019s awareness between the air picture \nprovided by TADIL J/Link 16 and the ground picture provided by other VHF/UHF data link \nformats. This two-channel radio dramatically reduces data latency and improves data \nintegrity between traditional network platforms and users at the edge for both situational \nawareness and C2. Link 16 and combat net radio built-in identification means that STT \nterminals provide blue force reporting to reduce blue-on-blue engagements and avoid \nfratricide. With standardized TADIL messages and Ethernet interfaces, the STT can be \nused with multiple computers in a wide range of applications.\nL3Harris is also the first Link 16 provider \nto integrate Concurrent Multinet (CMN) \nand Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) \nadvancements across its portfolio of Non-\nDevelopmental Items, providing warfighters \nwith Concurrent Multiple Reception (CMR) \ncapabilities for assured access to mission-\ncritical information. These features, coupled \nwith Link 16 Enhanced Throughput (ET) modes, \nwill enable network planners to fully optimize \nnetwork performance, allowing maximum \nparticipants sharing maximum capacity of \ninformation to support evolving mission requirements. The STT also implements the \nlatest high assurance algorithms using a field proven programmable Cryptographic \nModernization compliant engine to securely serve joint and coalition mission requirements, \nwhile maintaining backwards compatibility with legacy communications systems. \nSimultaneous Two-Channel Comms for Air and Ground InteroperabilityMISSION FLEXIBILITY\n >Dual-channel radio\n >Link 16 and VHF/UHF waveforms\n >Voice and wideband data capable\n >Low size, weight and power\n >Lower acquisition costs\n >Multi-mission, multi-user and \nmulti-waveform\n >Meets current and future \nrequirements\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS\n >Friendly force tracking\n >Air and surface picture\n >Interfaces with:\n -L3Harris Link 16 toolset\n -Air Defense Systems Integrator \n(ADSI\u00ae)\n -Joint Range Extension (JRE)\n -TRAX\n -BOSS\n -CAYMAN\n -CDLIM\n -Gateway Manager\n -SPIDR\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL\n >J12 mission management to any \nnon-C2\n >Status/weapons load/play times\n >WILCO/CANTCO\nTARGET ATTACK\n >Shortens kill chain\u2014F2T2EA \n(Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, \nAssess)\n >JTAC target POSID/9-line/BDA\n >Target update\n >Video, imagery and data\n >Mobile target attack\nNSA CERTIFIEDSecure, Low SWaP  \nLOS Communications\n >Link 16\n >Legacy VHF/UHF\n >Satcom >Wideband UHF\n -SRW*\n -ANW2*\nThese item(s)/data have been reviewed in accordance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), \n22 CFR part 120.11, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR 734(3)(b)(3), and may be released \nwithout export restrictions. \nL3Harris Technologies is an agile global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end \nsolutions that meet customers\u2019 mission-critical needs.
